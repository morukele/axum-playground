# axum-playground

- A repository for learning how to build webservers using the Axum Framework.

- The framework is similar to Actix-Web, however, I like the modularity with the tower ecosystem.

- The repo is just a simple TODO application with a DB.

- I find it easy to add logging support to the server, it was more intuitive than actix-web.
